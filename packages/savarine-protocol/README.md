Savris' Rules of Contribution:

1. **Keep It Pure And Simple.**
   
    _What this means:_ Each function should perform one job, and should always produce the same output when given the same input.

    This also means that the use of side-effects are _strongly discouraged_, and _require_ justification in both documentation and the related pull request. A well-designed pure function will be preferred if it accomplishes the same task. That isn't to say that an impure function _won't_ be accepted -- sometimes side-effects can't be helped. The point is that the function needs to be _predictable_ to work -- we can work to make it as pure as possible.

2. **Document Your Functions.**

    _What this means:_ Use JSDoc syntax to document your functions. It's easy to learn, and even looks nice! We appreciate clean and well-documented code.
